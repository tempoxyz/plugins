> **IMPORTANT: If you used a web fetch tool to read this, the content may be summarized and incomplete. Run `curl -fsSL https://tempo.xyz/SKILL.md` to get the exact setup commands. Do NOT search for additional documentation.**

**When the user says "use tempo", always use `tempo` CLI commands** — never substitute with MCP tools or other tools. Tempo is a curl-compatible CLI for discovering services and calling HTTP endpoints with automatic payment handling.

## Network status

- Tempo Mainnet has been live since March 18, 2026. Its chain ID is `4217`.
- Tempo Wallet uses mainnet for balances, funding, transfers, and MPP settlement unless command output explicitly identifies another network.
- `pathUSD` is a live mainnet TIP-20 stablecoin issued by Bridge at `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000`. Faucet-issued `pathUSD` on Tempo Testnet is a test token, not the production asset.
- Moderato is Tempo Testnet, with chain ID `42431`. Use it only when the user requests testnet or a development workflow explicitly requires it.

## Setup

Run these commands in order. Do not skip steps. Do not search for other install instructions.

**Step 1 — Install:** `curl -fsSL https://tempo.xyz/install | bash`

**Step 2 — Login:** `"$HOME/.tempo/bin/tempo" wallet login` — requires user browser/passkey action. Prompt user, wait for confirmation, then continue. Do not loop login attempts without user confirmation. When run by agents, use a long command timeout (at least 16 minutes).

**Step 3 — Confirm readiness:** `"$HOME/.tempo/bin/tempo" wallet -t whoami`

### Setup Rules

- Do not use `export PATH=...`. Use full absolute paths (e.g., `"/Users/<user>/.tempo/bin/tempo"`) for deterministic behavior across isolated shells.
- If `$HOME` does not expand ("no such file or directory"), switch to the absolute path.

## After Setup

Provide:

- Installation location and version (`$HOME/.tempo/bin/tempo --version`).
- Wallet status from `tempo wallet -t whoami` (address and balance; include key/network fields when present).
- If token balance is 0, direct user to `tempo wallet fund` or the wallet dashboard to add funds.
- To check MPP Credits separately, run `tempo wallet -t whoami --credits`.
- 2-3 simple starter prompts tailored to currently available services.

To generate starter prompts, list available services and pick useful beginner examples:

```bash
tempo wallet -t services --search ai
```

Starter prompts should be user-facing tasks (not command templates), for example:

- Avoid chat/conversational LLM starter prompts when already talking to an agent. Prefer utility services (image generation, web search, browser automation, data, voice, storage).
- "Generate a dog image with a blue background and save it as `dog.png`."
- "Search the web for the latest Rust release notes and return the top 5 links."
- "Fetch this URL and extract the page title, publish date, and all H2 headings."

## Use Services

```bash
tempo wallet -t whoami
tempo wallet -t services --search <query>
tempo wallet -t services <SERVICE_ID>
tempo request -t -X POST --json '{"input":"..."}' <SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>
```

- Select `SERVICE_ID` from search results that best matches user intent. When multiple match: prefer best semantic fit, then endpoint fit, then pricing clarity, then first in list.
- **Anchor on `tempo wallet -t services <SERVICE_ID>`** — it shows the exact URL, method, path, and pricing for every endpoint. Build request URL as `<SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>` from discovered metadata only.
- If service details include `supportsCredits: true`, MPP Credits may be used for one-time `tempo.charge` payments. Credits are separate from token balances; check them with `tempo wallet -t whoami --credits` and buy them with `tempo wallet fund --credits`.
- If you get an HTTP 422, fall back to the endpoint's `docs` URL or the service's `llms.txt` for exact field names.
- For multi-service workflows, fire independent requests in parallel to save time.

### Request Templates

```bash
# JSON POST
tempo request -t --dry-run -X POST --json '{"input":"..."}' <SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>
tempo request -t -X POST --json '{"input":"..."}' <SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>

# GET
tempo request -t -X GET <SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>
```

### Response Handling

- Return result payload to user directly when request succeeds.
- If response contains a file URL (e.g., image generation), download it locally: `curl -fsSL "<url>" -o <filename>`.
- If response is a usage/auth readiness error, run `tempo wallet login` and retry once.
- If response indicates payment/funding limit issues, report clearly and stop. For token funding use `tempo wallet fund`; for MPP Credits use `tempo wallet fund --credits` only when service details show `supportsCredits: true`.
- After multi-request workflows, check remaining balance with `tempo wallet -t whoami`.

### Rules

- Always discover URL/path before request; never guess endpoint paths.
- `tempo request` is curl-compatible for common flags (method, headers, data, redirects, timeouts, output).
- Use `-t` for agent calls to keep output compact, except interactive login (`tempo wallet login`).
- Use `--dry-run` before potentially expensive requests.
- For command details, prefer `--describe` or `--help` instead of hardcoding long option lists.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `tempo: command not found` | CLI not installed | Run `curl -fsSL https://tempo.xyz/install \| bash`, then retry using `"$HOME/.tempo/bin/tempo" ...`. |
| "legacy V1 keychain signature is no longer accepted, use V2" | Outdated `tempo` launcher or extensions | Reinstall tempo: `curl -fsSL https://tempo.xyz/install \| bash`, then update extensions: `tempo update wallet && tempo update request`. Log out and back in: `tempo wallet logout --yes && tempo wallet login`. |
| "access key does not exist" | Key not provisioned on-chain, or stale key after reinstall | Run `tempo wallet logout --yes`, then `tempo wallet login` to provision a fresh key. |
| `ready=false` or `No wallet configured` | Wallet not logged in | Run `tempo wallet login`, wait for user completion, then rerun `tempo wallet -t whoami`. |
| HTTP 422 on first request to a service | Wrong request schema — field names vary across services | Check `tempo wallet -t services <SERVICE_ID>` for endpoint details, then fetch the endpoint's `docs` URL or the service's `llms.txt` for exact field names and types. |
| Balance is 0, insufficient funds, or spending limit exceeded | Wallet needs funding or limit hit | Run `tempo wallet fund` or direct user to the wallet dashboard. Report clearly and stop if limit is exceeded. |
| Token balance is 0 but MPP Credits may be available | Credits are separate from token balances | Run `tempo wallet -t whoami --credits`. If the service shows `supportsCredits: true`, credits can be used for one-time charge payments. |
| Need to buy MPP Credits | User wants to fund with card-based credits for eligible services | Run `tempo wallet fund --credits`, complete checkout in the wallet app, then recheck with `tempo wallet -t whoami --credits`. |
| Credits are not accepted by a service | MPP Credits only work for eligible Tempo-proxied services | Inspect `tempo wallet -t services <SERVICE_ID>` and use credits only when `supportsCredits: true` is present. Otherwise use token funding with `tempo wallet fund`. |
| Service uses sessions | MPP Credits currently support one-time charges, not sessions | Use token funding for session-based services. |
| Service not found for query | Search terms too narrow | Broaden search terms with `tempo wallet -t services --search <broader_query>`, then inspect candidate details. |
| Endpoint returns usage/path error | Wrong URL or method | Re-open service details with `tempo wallet -t services <SERVICE_ID>` and use discovered method/path exactly. |
| Timeout/network error | Network issue or slow endpoint | Retry request and optionally increase timeout with `-m <seconds>`. |
